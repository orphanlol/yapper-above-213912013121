    <h3>What is SH1MMER?</h3>
    <p>
      SH1MMER is an exploit capable of completely unenrolling
      enterprise-managed Chromebooks. It was found by
      <u onclick="alert(messages.mercury)">the Mercury Workshop team</u> and
      was released on January,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.friday)">Friday the 13th</u>, 2023.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section blue">
    <p>
      Regarding the current status of sh1mmer:<br>
      The prebuilt binaries have been taken off of the official mirror (dl.sh1mmer.me), mostly due to copyright
      concerns but we're also tired of all the harassment and toxicity from the community, and from now on
      you'll have to build it from source.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="section green">
    <h3>What you will need</h3>
    <li>A USB with at least 8 GBs of storage</li>
    <li>
      <u onclick="alert(messages.pc)">A personal computer or chromebook;</u> note that you
      need admin perms on Windows/MacOS
    </li>
    <hr />
    <h3>Writing to USB</h3>
    <p>
      First, you'll need to find your managed Chromebook's board name. This can
      be done by going to <kbd>chrome://version</kbd> on your Chromebook and
      copying the word after "stable-channel", or with
      <u onclick="alert(messages.board)">a variety of other methods</u>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your board name is in the list below, your board has a publicly leaked RMA shim. If it's not, you'll have to
      source it
      on your own... somehow.
    </p>
    brask, brya, clapper, coral, dedede, enguarde, glimmer, grunt, hana,
    hatch, jacuzzi, kukui, nami, octopus, orco, pyro, reks, sentry, stout,
    strongbad, tidus, ultima, volteer, zork
    <p>
      First you need to download a sh1mmer bin. Download a shim at <a href="https://files.ultimatesrv.com/">files.ultimatesrv.com</a><br> , and build it with the <a href="builder.html">sh1mmer web builder</a><br>
      Once you've obtained a MODIFIED SHIM (NOT A RAW SHIM), you can continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Download the
      <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocpnlppkickgojjlmhdmidojbmbodfm">
        Chromebook Recovery Utility extension
      </a>
      <spc></spc>
      on your personal computer as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the downloads are complete,
      <u onclick="alert(messages.launch)">launch the recovery utility</u>
      and plug your USB into your personal computer. Note that your USB will
      be completely cleared and partitioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the recovery utility window, click the settings icon and press "use
      local image".
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/recovery_utility.png" />
    <p>
      Select your shim file, identify your USB, and start the writing process.
      This will take about 10 minutes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>Executing on Chromebook</h3>
    <p>
      Once writing is complete, enter recovery mode on your Chromebook. This
      is done by pressing the power button, reload key (â†»), and esc key at the
      same time. Your screen should look one of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/recover_black.png" />
    <img src="/assets/recover_white.png" />
    <p>Press <kbd>ctrl+d</kbd> on this screen, then press enter.</p>
    <p>
      It will now say something about "returning to secure mode" or that "OS
      verification is off". You will most likely not actually be in dev mode,
      but the exploit will work regardless. Your screen should look like one
      of the images below:
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/confirm_black.png" />
    <img src="/assets/confirm_white.png" />
    <p>
      On this screen, press the power button, reload key (â†»), and esc key at
      the same time again! This is very important and cannot be skipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once it re-shows the original recovery screen, plug your shimmed USB
      into your Chromebook, and press the power button, reload key (â†»), and
      esc key again. After a brief black-and-white loading screen, you should
      be in the SH1MMER menu.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/utils-select01.png" />
    <p>Play around with the UI, exit, and reboot.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>What now?</h3>
    <p>
      You will now be able to, among other things, unenroll your Chromebook.
      It will now behave entirely as if it is a personal computer and no
      longer contain spyware or blocker extensions. After you do this and get
      past the "determining device configuration" screen, you will be able to
      actually turn dev mode on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that while unenrolled, it is recommended to add your personal
      account first, then add your school account, then switch between the two
      as needed. Mercury Workshop does not condone the use of SH1MMER or
      unenrolling to cheat in school.
    </p>
    <p>
      The biggest challenges with unenrolling are connecting to the school
      network and taking state or national exams (since there are no kiosk
      apps anymore).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many methods to get a school Wi-Fi password while enrolled,
      including
      <a href="https://luphoria.com/netlog-policy-password-tool">the policy netlog trick</a>. While on a school account
      and unenrolled, you can bypass Wi-Fi blocks
      by using a secure DNS such as Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 from
      <kbd>chrome://os-settings/osPrivacy</kbd>. It is also recommended to
      enable "MAC Address Randomization" in <kbd>chrome://flags</kbd> to stay
      hidden.
    </p>
    <img src="/assets/secure_dns.png" />
    <img src="/assets/mac_randomization.png" />
    <p>
      To take a kiosk exam, the safest option is to re-enroll temporarily.
      Instructions for doing that are hosted
      <a href="/kiosks.txt">at this TXT file</a>. Saving a copy of this file
      for future reference is probably a smart move.
